# Attrition of Nurses in US Healthcare

Built a model to predict employee (nurse) attrition in the US Healthcare System using classification techniques that take into account multiple factors that influence staff attrition.


## Steps performed in the Notebook:

+ **Data Preprocessing** : To prepare the data for classification analysis.
+ **Exploratory Data Analysis** : Basic Data Analysis and Visualizations to gain insight from the dataset.
+ **Label Encoding** : Applied to categorical features in the dataset to transform them into numerical representations.
+ **Train Test Split** : To divide the dataset into training and testing set for assessing the model's performance.
+ **Machine Learning Classification Models** : I have used *Decision Tree Classifier*, *Random Forest Classifier*, and *XGBoost Classifier* to find the model that works best using several evaluation metrics.
+ **Interpretation**: Used SHAP to explain which features have the most significant impact on individual predictions.

**Open the Notebook in Jupyter Lab or Google Colab to execute all the steps and re-train the models for your intended purpose.**
